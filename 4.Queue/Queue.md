A Queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

A Queue works on the following operations:

- `enqueue` adds an element to the end of the queue.
- -  Removes the first element from an array and returns it. If the array is empty, undefined is returned and the array is not modified.
- `dequeue` removes an element from the start of the queue.
- `isEmpty` checks if the queue is empty.
- `size` returns the number of elements in the queue.
- `front` gets the front item from the queue.
- `print` prints all the elements of the queue.
